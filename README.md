Fitness Tracker: Barbell Exercise Classifier
This project series provides a comprehensive guide to building an automated fitness tracker using Python. By leveraging accelerometer and gyroscope data, the system classifies specific barbell exercises and counts repetitions, transforming raw sensor data into actionable workout insights.

🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal is to develop a robust pipeline of Python scripts capable of:

Processing & Modeling: Handling raw accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data.

Exercise Classification: Automatically identifying five key lifts: Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Barbell Row, and Squat.

Repetition Counting: Implementing algorithms to accurately count the number of reps performed in each set.
